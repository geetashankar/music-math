    "*You are singing a full-length concert with many songs in which you will be singing kalpana swarams. Unfortunately, you did not have time to prepare korvais for each of these songs ahead of time. Not only are these songs in a variety of talams, but you are also singing kalpana swarams to some **atypical** edams. How can you quickly calculate the number of counts that you will need to make a korvai, given any arbitrary talam and edupu?*"

    "## Theory Behind Korvai Count Calculator\n",
    "My laya guru, Shri M.N.Hariharan, taught me this simple formula to quickly figure out how many counts you need to construct a korvai given a talam and edupu.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Terms and Equations\n",
    "AS = after samam <br>\n",
    "BS = before samam <br>\n",
    "SS = samam to samam <br>\n",
    "E = edupu <br>\n",
    "**SS = AS + BP** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Find AS for any talam\n",
    "SS (samam to samam) is the number of counts in a talam. First we find the closest number to SS that is divisible by 3. Let's take Adi Talam as an example. The closest mulitple of 3 to 32 is 33. We divide this number by 3 to get the AS, so for Adi Talam, the AS is 11. However, let us say we are singing in Misra Jumpa Talam which has a total of 40 counts. The nearest mulitple of 3 to 40 is 39, which we got by *subtracting 1*. Therefore, when we divide 39 by 3 to get 13, we have calculated the BS. To find the AS, we simply do SS - BS and get 40-13 = 27. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Using AS to Find a Korvai Count for Any Edupu (that is not already divisible by 3)\n",
    "Now that we have the AS of the talam we are singing in, we need to figure out how many counts to construct our korvai in, given any edupu. If you have an edupu E, find the closest multiple of 3 that is less than E. (You should always be finding a number that is *1 or 2 less than E* if you are calculating this correctly.) \n",
    "\n",
    "If you found a number 1 less than E that is divisible by 3:\n",
    "**Korvai count = (E - 1)/3 + AS**\n",

    "If you found a number 2 less than E that is divisible by 3:\n",
    "**Korvai count = (E - 2)/3 + (2 x AS)**\n",

    "AS = 11\n",

    "Korvai count = (4-1)/3 + 11 = 1 + 11 = **12** \n",
